# 1) The Core Market Gap

Most hiking resources are:

- adult-focused
- difficulty-rated without kid context
- unclear on safety for children
- lacking progression systems
- overwhelming for new parents
- not filtered by kid suitability
- not personalized to your location

Families struggle with:

- not knowing which trails are safe
- overestimating difficulty
- underestimating terrain risks
- mixed-age capability
- lack of structured skill progression

HikingForKids.com fills that gap.
